# 🎓 Student Portfolio – Siadat Ali

Welcome to my practice **HTML-only** portfolio project! This is a beginner-level static webpage created to strengthen my skills in writing clean and semantic HTML.

## 📄 Overview

This portfolio showcases:

- A personal introduction
- A project showcase section
- Academic grades with topics learned
- A fully functional contact/feedback form

The webpage is written in **pure HTML** (no CSS or JavaScript yet) and uses semantic elements like `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`.

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Structuring HTML with semantic tags
- Creating navigation using internal links
- Organizing content with headings and lists
- Building a form using various input types (`text`, `email`, `radio`, `checkbox`, etc.)
- Inserting images with proper `alt` text
- Creating tables with multiple rows and columns
- Accessibility basics (`alt`, `label`, etc.)
- Adding metadata and favicons in `<head>`

---

## 🔧 To Do Next

- Style with CSS for better layout and design
- Add interactivity using JavaScript
- Make the form functional with a backend or service like Formspree
- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles and keyboard navigation
